            <p>In this section, I will share a bit about myself. I'm a 19-year-old guy originally from Islamabad, Pakistan. However, I've spent most of my life in Barcelona, Spain, where I grew up. When I was 12, my family and I moved to the UK in search of better opportunities. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by technology, and it's been my dream to pursue a career in this field. Making my parents proud is another driving force for me, which is why I always strive to work hard and achieve success for both my family and myself. Below you can check out my education history and my skills.</p>

                        <p>Currently, I'm studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University. Here, I've been learning a variety of things like Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of React too. I know there's still a lot more to learn as next year I'll be diving into Full-Stack Development. Plus, there are more units on the horizon that will further enhance my skills, preparing me for the real world ahead.</p>

                    <h4>Programming Languages Skills</h4>
                    <p>I have a solid understanding in various programming languages such as Python, C#, and Java. These languages helped me write instructions that computers understand, helping me create software applications and solve complex problems. When it comes to building a website, I can use my coding skills to bring ideas to life. I've made some small projects at the start such as a game using Java, a calculator with Python, a software that calculates the cost of fuel depending on vehicle, amount of miles they could travel with C#, and so on.</p>

                    <p>I have experience working with different methodologies such as Agile. By following the Agile principles like Scrum or Kanban, I worked effectively with my team to deliver a high-quality software. This was done in university, where I worked with my team and created a website to tackle an issue that every university student has, and it's money management. We also prioritized testing so that the code was running smooth and to ensure that everything was running as we expected.</p>

                <h3>Toy Car Factory Game</h3>
                <p>For this project, I used Processing (Java) to design a game in which players must arrange toy cars with the correct colour in the appropriate boxes. The player begins with three lives, which getsÂ reduced if they make a mistake or let a car to cross the conveyor belt's end. If all of the player's lives are lost, a "Game Over" screen appears. Along with showing me more about interactive features and game dynamics, this project helped me become more proficient with loops and conditionals in code and strengthened my problem-solving skills as I worked through a variety of challenges.</p>

                <h3>LibroLand Website</h3>
                <p>For this project, I built an e-commerce website called "LibroLand" to sell books using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also compatible on mobile which is good for the user so that they can access it in more than 1 device. I added a dark mode option, so users can choose their preferred viewing experience, and this choice stays saved as they browse. The homepage features various books, and there's an "About Us" section that shares the company's mission. When users want to make a purchase, they go to a payment page to enter their credit card details. I tested the JavaScript by intentionally making errors to ensure that error messages showed up correctly. After entering the right information, users get a confirmation pop-up and are directed to a thank-you page that shows the last four digits of their card. This project helped me improve my web development skills and taught me the importance of creating a user-friendly experience, which will be valuable in real-life situations.</p>
