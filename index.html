            <p>In this section, I will share a bit about myself. I'm a 19-year-old originally from Islamabad, Pakistan.
                However, I've spent most of my life in Barcelona, Spain, where I grew up. When I was 12, my family and I
                moved to the UK in search of better opportunities. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by technology,
                and it's been my dream to pursue a career in this field. Making my parents proud is another driving
                force for me, which is why I always strive to work hard and achieve success for both my family and
                myself. Below you can check out my education history and my skills.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I'm studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University.
                        Here, I've been learning a variety of things like Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of
                        React too. I know there's still a lot more to learn as next year I'll be diving into Full-Stack
                        Development. Plus, there are more units on the horizon that will further enhance my skills,
                        preparing me for the real world ahead.</p>

                    <p>At this point in my journey, I chose to pursue a BTEC ICT Level 3 Diploma alongside A-Level Media
                        Studies. My primary focus was on ICT, where I began learning coding languages like Python and
                        C#, and engaged in enrichments related to Cybersecurity. For my BTEC, I achieved a D*D* grade,
                        whereas for my A-Level, I achieved a grade B.</p>

                    <p>Kingsway Park High School was where my journey with technology began. It's where I took my GCSEs
                        and earned 9 of them, with grades between 4 and 9. This experience solidified my passion for
                        technology, confirming that it was the right path for me.</p>

                    My skills have been developed through my BSc in Software Engineering, focusing on practical
                    application in programming, web development, and database management. I am proficient in languages
                    like <span>Java</span>, <span>Python</span>, and <span>C#</span>, with hands-on experience in the
                    <span>MySQL</span> and <span>MongoDB</span> relational and non-relational database models. My web
                    stack includes <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, <span>JavaScript</span>, and frameworks like
                    <span>Node.js</span>, <span>Express.js</span>, and <span>Vue.js</span> for building functional
                    applications. Beyond technical proficiency, I pride myself on strong <span>teamwork</span>,
                    <span>problem-solving</span>, and <span>adaptability</span>, skills honed through my thematic
                    project and extracurricular activities like gaming and football.

                <h3>Toy Car Factory Game</h3>
                <p>In this project, I used Processing (Java) to create a game where players arrange toy cars by color
                    into the correct boxes. Players start with three lives, which decrease if they make a mistake or let
                    a car fall off the conveyor belt. If all lives are lost, a "Game Over" screen appears. This project
                    enhanced my understanding of interactive features and game dynamics while improving my proficiency
                    with loops and conditionals, and it strengthened my problem-solving skills through various
                    challenges.</p>

                <h3>LibroLand Website</h3>
                <p>I developed "LibroLand," an e-commerce website for selling books using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
                    site is mobile-friendly, allowing users to toggle dark mode for their session. The homepage features
                    various books and an "About Us" section explaining our mission. During checkout, users enter credit
                    card details on a secure page. I tested JavaScript to ensure proper error messages and implemented a
                    confirmation pop-up after successful payments, directing users to a thank-you page displaying the
                    last four digits of their card. This project improved my web development skills and highlighted the
                    importance of a user-friendly experience.</p>
