            <p>In this section, I will share a bit about myself. I'm a 19-year-old originally from Islamabad, Pakistan. However, I've spent most of my life in Barcelona, Spain, where I grew up. When I was 12, my family and I moved to the UK in search of better opportunities. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by technology, and it's been my dream to pursue a career in this field. Making my parents proud is another driving force for me, which is why I always strive to work hard and achieve success for both my family and myself. Below you can check out my education history and my skills.</p>                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taha-jilani-naveed-034600288/" target="_blank"><i class='bx bxl-linkedin'></i></a>

                <h3>Toy Car Factory Game</h3>
                <p>In this project, I used Processing (Java) to create a game where players arrange toy cars by color into the correct boxes. Players start with three lives, which decrease if they make a mistake or let a car fall off the conveyor belt. If all lives are lost, a "Game Over" screen appears. This project enhanced my understanding of interactive features and game dynamics while improving my proficiency with loops and conditionals, and it strengthened my problem-solving skills through various challenges.</p>            </div>

                <h3>LibroLand Website</h3>
                <p>I developed "LibroLand," an e-commerce website for selling books using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is mobile-friendly, allowing users to toggle dark mode for their session. The homepage features various books and an "About Us" section explaining our mission. During checkout, users enter credit card details on a secure page. I tested JavaScript to ensure proper error messages and implemented a confirmation pop-up after successful payments, directing users to a thank-you page displaying the last four digits of their card. This project improved my web development skills and highlighted the importance of a user-friendly experience.</p>            </div>
